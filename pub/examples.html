            By clicking on a word in the cloud, it will be highlighted in the text. This can be useful

            <h3>Coronavirus Disease Vaccine Analysis</h3>
            An analysis of the current coronavirus disease in Canada has been conducted. 
            The vaccines that are currently approved for use in Canada are Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, AstraZeneca,
            COVISHIELD, and Janssen. Janssen is the only vaccine that is given in one dose. 
            The coronavirus vaccination began in Canada in the week of December 13, 2020.
            Over 9 million first doses of the vaccine have been administered which is around 20% of the total
            population, while just under 1 million have received their second dose of the vaccine.
            We know that one dose of the vaccine has an 80% effectiveness against the coronavirus
            disease. For more coronavirus vaccine updates, subscribe to our newsletter.

            This is a text analysis generated from a sample student essay.
            From this analysis, we can see patterns such as the student using words 
            such as React and learned extremely frequently. After analyzing the results, the student
            can make edits to their paper accordingly.
            Because we are generating the analysis within a container, we can style the container separately,
            for example, let's push our text analysis to the left side.

            <h3>CSC309 Course Review</h3>
            This winter semester, I have decided to take the course CSC309, Programming on the Web.
            From this course, I learned that web development is extremely difficult! Therefore, I will spend
            more time this summer learning more about web development and libraries like React. 
            I also learned about React libraries such as React Bootstrap and more things about React.
            One thing that I really liked about React was how easy it was to use. I think my future projects 
            will involve more React over other libraries and frameworks. I also learned about other backend frameworks
            such as Express.js and how to create a server. Next year I want to learn about Angular and Vue!

              graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school,
              three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. 
              I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come 
              back different. Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. 
              Hear about Frankie? Yeah. You going to the funeral? No, I'm not going. 
              Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel.
              Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. 
              I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. 
              That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under
